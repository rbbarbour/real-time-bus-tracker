# Houston METRO Real Time Bus Tracker

## About
This project is an expansion on the real time bus tracker exercise that was done as part of the MIT MERN Stack Professional Coding class.  Initially we tracked the bus stop positions of a bus that runs between MIT and Harvard.  I've expanded this to track a random bus from the Houston METRO fleet using <a href="https://api-portal.ridemetro.org/">JSON data provided by Houston METRO.</a>

## How to run
Clone the files to a local folder and open index.html in a web browser.
With the map open, click the "Track random bus" button to begin tracking a random bus in the Houston METRO fleet

## Roadmap
<ul>
<li>Allow users to select bus they want to track</li>
<li>Allow users to see all the buses on a particular route</li>
</ul>
